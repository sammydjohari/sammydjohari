### :motor_scooter: :ramen: Hobbies and interests
Besides from coding, I really love designing stuff, clothes, jewelry, graphics, you name it. I have a strong passion for fashion and music. I find joy in great food, great wine, travelling, art, architecture, cars, old watches, great interiors and much more. I have a dream of travelling to Tokyo, mostly because of my love for their culture, but also for my interests.
